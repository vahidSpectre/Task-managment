# Getting Started

Prerequisites
To run this React app, you'll need the following:

Node.js and npm (or yarn): Download and install them from https://nodejs.org/en.

# Installation

Navigate to the project directory:

Bash
cd todo

# Install the project dependencies:

npm install

(or)

yarn install

# Running the App

Start the development server:

npm start

(or)

yarn start

This will launch the development server and open your app in the browser at http://localhost:3000 by default.

Make changes to your code and watch as the browser automatically refreshes to reflect the updates.

# Building for Production

Build an optimized production-ready version:

Bash
npm run build

(or)

Bash
yarn build

This will create a production build in the build folder. This folder can then be deployed to a hosting platform of your choice.
